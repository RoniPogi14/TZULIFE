            Once a Shih Tzu reaches 8 years old, they enter their senior stage. This period requires extra care, as<br>
            they may experience age-related health changes, decreased energy levels, and the need for specialized <br>
            nutrition and medical attention.. <br>

                            <li>Slower Metabolism & Weight Changes â€“ Some seniors gain weight due to lower activity, <br>
                                while others may lose weight due to underlying health conditions.</li>
                            <li>Reduced Energy Levels â€“ They sleep more and may not be as playful as before.</li>
                            <li>Increased Sensitivity to Temperature â€“ More prone to overheating in hot weather <br>
                                and getting cold in cooler temperatures.</li>
                            <li>Changes in Vision & Hearing â€“ Possible cataracts, dry eye, or hearing loss.</li>
                            <li>Joint Stiffness & Mobility Issues â€“ May experience arthritis, making movements slower or more painful.</li>

                            <strong>Diet & Nutrition</strong>
                            <br>âœ” Switch to senior dog food with lower calories but rich in protein and fiber.
                            <br>âœ” Include joint supplements like glucosamine & chondroitin to support mobility.
                            <br>âœ” Ensure adequate omega fatty acids for skin, coat, and cognitive health.
                            <br>âœ” Keep them hydratedâ€”older dogs may not drink enough water.<br><br>
                            <strong>Exercise & Activity</strong>
                            <br>âœ” Regular but gentle exercise (short walks, light play) to maintain mobility.
                            <br>âœ” Avoid high-impact activities that can strain their joints.
                            <br>âœ” Mental stimulation (puzzle toys, gentle training) helps prevent cognitive decline.<br><br>

                            <strong>Training & Behavioral Adjustments</strong>
                            <br>âœ” Maintain a consistent daily routine to reduce stress.
                            <br>âœ” Allow more rest time and avoid disrupting their sleep.
                            <br>âœ” Be patientâ€”senior dogs may take longer to respond due to cognitive changes.<br><br>

                            <strong>Grooming Routine</strong>
                            <br>âœ” Brush regularly to prevent matting and keep the coat healthy.
                            <br>âœ” Check for skin lumps or sores, which become more common with age.
                            <br>âœ” Trim nails often, as reduced activity may not wear them down naturally.

                            <strong>Health Considerations</strong>
                            <br>ðŸ’¡ Joint & Mobility Issues â€“ Arthritis is common; provide orthopedic beds and ramps to reduce strain.
                            <br>ðŸ’¡ Dental Health Decline â€“ Increased risk of gum disease and tooth loss; regular vet cleanings are recommended.
                            <br>ðŸ’¡ Vision & Eye Problems â€“ Watch for cataracts, dry eye, or corneal ulcers.
                            <br>ðŸ’¡ Heart & Respiratory Health â€“ Short-nosed breeds are prone to heart disease and breathing issues.
                            <br>ðŸ’¡ Cognitive Decline â€“ Some seniors develop Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (dog dementia), 
                            <br>   leading to confusion, restlessness, or changes in sleeping patterns. <br><br>
