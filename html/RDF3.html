        <p><strong>UNDERWEIGHT:</strong> Ribs, spine, and pelvic bones are easily visible with little to no fat covering. The waist and abdominal tuck are pronounced.</p>
        <p><strong>IDEAL:</strong> Ribs can be felt without excess fat covering. The waist is observable behind the ribs when viewed from above, and the abdomen is tucked up when viewed from the side.</p>
        <p><strong>OVERWEIGHT:</strong> Ribs are difficult to feel due to a thick fat covering. The waist is absent or barely visible, and there may be a noticeable abdominal sag.</p>
        <p><strong>OBESE:</strong> Ribs are not palpable under heavy fat layers. There is no waist, and significant abdominal distension is present. Fat deposits are noticeable over the lumbar area, base of the tail, and neck.</p>
